La principal caracter√≠stica de esta funci√≥n es que permite eliminar caracter√≠sticas especificando una tolerancia, es decir, el n√∫mero m√≠nimo de observaciones distintas que una caracter√≠stica debe tener. En el ejemplo a continuaci√≥n, se establece que las caracter√≠sticas pueden tener hasta un 65% de un mismo valor repetido; de lo contrario, deben ser eliminadas.\n",

Esto permite evaluar r√°pidamente cu√°les combinaciones tienen m√°s potencial sin invertir demasiado tiempo y recursos en el proceso inicial. A medida que avanza, el algoritmo elimina las combinaciones menos prometedoras y retiene solo las mejores.

    "Optuna es una biblioteca de c√≥digo abierto dise√±ada para la optimizaci√≥n autom√°tica de hiperpar√°metros y la b√∫squeda de configuraciones √≥ptimas de algoritmos de aprendizaje autom√°tico. Su objetivo es ayudar a los cient√≠ficos de datos y los ingenieros a encontrar la mejor combinaci√≥n de hiperpar√°metros para un modelo de aprendizaje autom√°tico dado, lo que puede mejorar significativamente el rendimiento de dicho modelo. Optuna se basa en t√©cnicas de optimizaci√≥n bayesiana y se ha convertido en una herramienta popular en el campo del aprendizaje autom√°tico.\n",

    "En resumidas cuentas optuna:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definici√≥n del espacio de b√∫squeda**: En primer lugar, se debe definir un espacio de b√∫squeda que incluya los hiperpar√°metros que se desean optimizar y sus rangos de valores posibles. Estos hiperpar√°metros pueden incluir la tasa de aprendizaje, el n√∫mero de capas ocultas en una red neuronal, el n√∫mero de √°rboles en un bosque aleatorio, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Funci√≥n objetivo**: Debes definir una funci√≥n objetivo que toma un conjunto de hiperpar√°metros como entrada y eval√∫a el rendimiento del modelo de aprendizaje autom√°tico utilizando esos hiperpar√°metros en un conjunto de datos de validaci√≥n o prueba. Esta funci√≥n debe ser la que deseas maximizar o minimizar, dependiendo de tus objetivos (por ejemplo, maximizar la precisi√≥n del modelo).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optimizaci√≥n bayesiana**: Optuna utiliza t√©cnicas de optimizaci√≥n bayesiana para explorar el espacio de b√∫squeda de manera eficiente. Comienza evaluando un conjunto inicial de hiperpar√°metros de forma aleatoria y, a medida que se acumulan m√°s evaluaciones, utiliza un modelo probabil√≠stico para predecir cu√°les podr√≠an ser las mejores combinaciones de hiperpar√°metros para explorar a continuaci√≥n. Esto permite una b√∫squeda m√°s inteligente y eficiente en lugar de una b√∫squeda exhaustiva.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Criterios de parada**: Puedes definir criterios de parada para detener la b√∫squeda una vez que se alcanza un cierto nivel de rendimiento o se supera un n√∫mero m√°ximo de evaluaciones.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Resultados y recomendaciones**: Una vez que la b√∫squeda de hiperpar√°metros finaliza, Optuna te proporciona la mejor configuraci√≥n de hiperpar√°metros encontrada, as√≠ como el valor √≥ptimo de la funci√≥n objetivo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optuna se ha convertido en una herramienta valiosa en la comunidad de aprendizaje autom√°tico y ha demostrado ser eficaz para encontrar configuraciones √≥ptimas de hiperpar√°metros en una amplia variedad de escenarios. Su enfoque basado en la optimizaci√≥n bayesiana ayuda a ahorrar tiempo y recursos en comparaci√≥n con una b√∫squeda exhaustiva o aleatoria de hiperpar√°metros."

    "1. Modelo probabil√≠stico: TPE se basa en la construcci√≥n de dos modelos probabil√≠sticos, uno para la funci√≥n objetivo (que deseas optimizar) y otro para la funci√≥n de probabilidad condicional. El modelo de probabilidad condicional se divide en dos partes: una que modela los puntos de exploraci√≥n (evaluaciones donde los hiperpar√°metros se ajustan para buscar nuevos puntos) y otra que modela los puntos de explotaci√≥n (evaluaciones donde los hiperpar√°metros se ajustan para maximizar la funci√≥n objetivo en las √°reas prometedoras).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Funci√≥n de probabilidad condicional: La funci√≥n de probabilidad condicional calcula la probabilidad de que un conjunto dado de hiperpar√°metros sea mejor que otro conjunto. La optimizaci√≥n se basa en encontrar los puntos que maximizan esta probabilidad.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Balance entre exploraci√≥n y explotaci√≥n: TPE equilibra la exploraci√≥n y la explotaci√≥n de manera eficiente. Durante la b√∫squeda, se enfoca en explorar nuevas √°reas del espacio de hiperpar√°metros mientras tambi√©n se explotan las √°reas prometedoras donde se espera encontrar mejores configuraciones.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Ajuste continuo del modelo: A medida que se recopilan m√°s datos de evaluaci√≥n, el modelo de TPE se ajusta continuamente para reflejar mejor la funci√≥n objetivo y la probabilidad condicional. Esto permite una b√∫squeda cada vez m√°s precisa a medida que se acumulan m√°s evaluaciones."
